# 🤖 **10. My AI Usage (MANDATORY for Kata)**



### **AI Tools Used**

* **ChatGPT (GPT-5.1)**
* **GitHub Copilot**

### **How AI Helped**

* Generated boilerplate for:

  * Controller structure
  * API route layout
  * React component drafts
* Helped write unit tests (Jest + RTL)
* Helped debug complex flows like:

  * Stock update logic
  * JWT middleware
  * Cart calculations
* Provided UI/UX ideas for the golden theme
* Helped generate documentation (README, summaries)

### **My Reflection**

AI significantly improved speed and reduced boilerplate time.
However:

* Business logic was fully handwritten
* Database design was done manually
* All AI code was reviewed, modified, and tested
* AI acted like a productivity assistant, not a code replacement
* TDD discipline was always kept → tests first, code second

### **Commit Transparency**

All commits influenced by AI include:

# 📚 **13. Troubleshooting**

### MongoDB connection error

→ Ensure DB is running
→ Update `.env`

### CORS issue

→ Check frontend `.env`

### Login fails

→ Password must be ≥6 chars
→ JWT secret must match

### Tests failing

→ Run MongoDB in test mode
→ Clear Jest cache
